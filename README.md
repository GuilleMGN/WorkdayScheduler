# WorkdayScheduler

This program is a workday timetable that allows a user to input their schedule every hour and the program will display in colours what time events have past, 
what events are current, and what events will come in the future. It is set to display the current day at the top and then all the hours from 9am to 9pm which 
have a text area to input any event the user wants in their schedule. Next to each time block there is a save button so the user can save whatever they typed 
in there, so that when the page is refreshed or reopened, the event stays there. This is stored in the local storage. Every time the page is loaded, the moment.js 
javascript gets the current date and time to display the correct information to the user.
